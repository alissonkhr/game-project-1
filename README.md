>Title: Pot Smash Simulator '97 

## Project Description
I want to create a game in an ode to one of my favorite game series: Zelda! One thing about the series that carries through mostly all of the games is breaking jars. Sometimes they have hearts, rupees, enemies, or other special items.
This game will be set to a time limit and the goal is to move from left to right breaking as many incoming jars as you can within that time limit and without losing all your lives.

## User Stories
### MVP Goals
- As a player, I want my game to recognize smashing a pot to add a point to the score.
- As a player, I would like to be informed when the game is over due to the time limit being reached or all lives lost.
- As a player, I would like to know how many points, lives, and time left I have while playing.
- As a player, I would like to be informed with some indication when I smash a pot so that I know my weapon worked.
- As a player, I would like to be informed with some indication when the time limit is close to being reached.
- As a player, I would like to be able to restart the game after the time is up.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging, but also out of the way, so that I can focus on smashing pots within the time I have.


### Stretch Goals
- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I reach the time limit without losing all my lives.
- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I smash a pot so I know it worked.
- As a player, I would like to be able to challenge another player online and have a split-screen pot smashing battle.

### Unsolved Problems

- I was not able to get the collision detection perfect for the player when smashing a jar, so that needs some revisiting.
- Still new to adding audio to a site and it seems my hosted webpage does not play the audio, but locally it works fine for me.

### Forthcoming Features

- Add winning and losing game images or other styling instead of alerts.

- Implement a second player and also change the way jars spawn to be more difficult and spread unevenly around the canvas.

- Create a red flash when 5 seconds are left on the canvas' timer.
